## 🚨 IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Check Browser Extensions:
- Disable ad blockers
- Disable icon blockers
- Try incognito mode

### Check Console:
```
Press F12 → Console tab
Look for icon loading errors
```

### Try Different Browser:
- Chrome
- Firefox  
- Edge

## 💡 WHY THIS HAPPENS

**Browser Cache:**
- Stores old version of components
- Icons were added after page was cached
- Hard refresh forces new download

**Next.js Cache:**
- `.next` folder stores compiled code
- Old build doesn't have icons
- Deleting forces fresh build

```
□ Server stopped
□ .next folder deleted
□ Server restarted
□ Browser hard refreshed (Ctrl+Shift+R)
□ Tried multiple refreshes
□ Checked in incognito mode
□ Icons now visible! ✅
```

**Status:** Icons are in code ✅  
**Issue:** Browser/build cache  
**Fix:** Clear cache + hard refresh  
**Time:** 1 minute
