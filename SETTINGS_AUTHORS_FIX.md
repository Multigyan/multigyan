## 🔄 HOW TO UPDATE IN FUTURE

### To Add New Settings:
```javascript
// 1. Add to state in page.js
const [settings, setSettings] = useState({
  // ... existing settings
  newSetting: false, // Add new setting
})

// 2. Add UI element
<Switch
  checked={settings.newSetting}
  onCheckedChange={(checked) => 
    handleSettingChange('newSetting', checked)
  }
/>

// 3. Update API if needed
// No changes needed to API - it saves all settings
```

### To Modify Password Rules:
```javascript
// In /app/api/users/change-password/route.js

// Current: min 8 characters
if (newPassword.length < 8) {
  // Change to 10 characters:
  if (newPassword.length < 10) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'New password must be at least 10 characters long' },
      { status: 400 }
    )
  }
}

// Add complexity requirements:
if (!/[A-Z]/.test(newPassword)) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Password must contain uppercase letter' },
    { status: 400 }
  )
}
```
