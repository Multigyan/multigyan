## 📁 Files I Modified

### 1. app/layout.js
**Change:** Added nprogress CSS import
```javascript
import 'nprogress/nprogress.css'
```
**Why:** So the loading bar styles are loaded

### 2. components/LoadingBar.jsx
**Change:** Rewrote with better code and comments
**Why:** Easier to understand and maintain

### 3. app/globals.css
**Change:** Already had NProgress styles
**Why:** Styles the loading bar to match your theme
