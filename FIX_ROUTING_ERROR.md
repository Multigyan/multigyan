# ðŸ”§ FIX ROUTING CONFLICT

## The Problem:
You have two dynamic routes in the same location with different parameter names:
- `app/author/[id]` 
- `app/author/[username]`

Next.js doesn't allow this!

## The Solution:
Delete the `app/author/[username]` directory.

---

## OPTION 1: Delete via VS Code (EASIEST)

1. Open VS Code
2. In the Explorer panel (left side), navigate to:
   ```
   app/author/
   ```
3. Right-click on `[username]` folder
4. Click "Delete"
5. Confirm deletion
6. Save and restart server

---

## OPTION 2: Delete via Command Line

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```powershell
# Delete the conflicting directory
Remove-Item -Path "D:\VS_Code\multigyan\app\author\[username]" -Recurse -Force
```

---

## OPTION 3: Delete via File Explorer

1. Open File Explorer (Windows + E)
2. Navigate to: `D:\VS_Code\multigyan\app\author\`
3. Find the folder named `[username]`
4. Delete it (Shift + Delete for permanent)

---

## After Deletion:

1. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The error should be gone!
3. Your author pages will work at: `/author/{id}`

---

## Why Keep `[id]` instead of `[username]`?

âœ… Consistent with your sitemap structure  
âœ… Better client-side loading states  
âœ… More robust error handling  
âœ… Works with search functionality  
âœ… IDs don't change (usernames might)  

---

## Once Fixed, Test:

Visit an author page:
```
http://localhost:3000/author/[SOME_AUTHOR_ID]
```

Should work perfectly! âœ…
