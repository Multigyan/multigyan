# ✅ ERROR FIXES & SEARCH IMPLEMENTATION

**All errors fixed! Search functionality added!** 🎉

---

## 🔴 ERROR 1: JSON Parse Error - FIXED ✅

### The Problem:
```
Console SyntaxError
Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

### What Caused It:
- Homepage (`app/page.js`) was calling: `/api/users/authors`
- This API endpoint didn't exist
- Next.js returned an HTML 404 page
- Code tried to parse HTML as JSON → ERROR!

### The Fix:
Created the missing API endpoint:
```
File: app/api/users/authors/route.js

Returns:
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 3  // Count of authors
}
```

### Additional Improvement:
Updated homepage with better error handling:
```javascript
// Before: Would crash if API failed
const response = await fetch('/api/users/authors')
const data = await response.json()

// After: Handles errors gracefully
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/users/authors')
  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json()
    // Use data
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error)
  // Continue without crashing
}
```
