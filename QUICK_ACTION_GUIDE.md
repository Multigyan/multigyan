## üí° **BEGINNER TIPS**

### **Tip 1: One Step at a Time**
Don't try to do everything at once. Complete Action 1, test it, then move to Action 2.

### **Tip 2: Take Screenshots**
Before and after each action, take screenshots. Helps with debugging if something goes wrong.

### **Tip 3: Use Git Commits**
After each successful action:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message about what you did"
git push
```

This lets you roll back if needed!

### **Tip 4: Test on Real Devices**
Don't just test on your computer. Test on:
- Your phone
- Friend's phone
- Tablet
- Different browsers

### **Tip 5: Ask for Help!**
If you're stuck for more than 15 minutes, ask me! Don't waste hours debugging alone.
