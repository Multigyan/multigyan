### 3. ⚡ **Automatic WebP Conversion**

**What it does:**
- Automatically converts all uploaded images to WebP format
- WebP images are 25-35% smaller than JPEG/PNG
- Faster page loading and better SEO
- Better user experience
- No quality loss (uses 90% quality setting)

**Where it works:**
- ✅ Featured Image uploads
- ✅ Content image uploads (in rich text editor)
- ✅ Both drag & drop and file selection

**Conversion Process:**
```
Original Image (JPEG/PNG)
    ↓
Browser converts to WebP (90% quality)
    ↓
Optimized WebP Image
    ↓
Upload to Cloudinary
    ↓
Display in your blog
```

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Faster Loading:** 25-35% smaller file sizes
- 💰 **Cost Savings:** Less bandwidth usage
- 📈 **Better SEO:** Google loves fast websites
- 🎯 **Same Quality:** No visible quality difference
- ♿ **Accessibility:** All browsers support WebP now

**Compression Info Display:**
When you upload an image, you'll see:
```
✓ Image optimized! 32.5% smaller
Original: 1024.50KB → Final: 691.20KB WebP
```

**What if my browser doesn't support WebP?**
Don't worry! The system automatically detects this and uses the original format instead.

**Note:** WebP conversion does NOT work for:
- Images added via URL (including Google Drive)
- Images already in WebP format
- GIF animations (to preserve animation)
