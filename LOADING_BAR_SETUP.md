# Loading Bar Installation & Setup

## Step 1: Install NProgress

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install nprogress
```

## Step 2: Files Already Created

I've created these files for you:
1. ✅ `components/LoadingBar.jsx` - Loading bar component
2. ✅ `app/globals.css` - Updated with NProgress styles

## Step 3: Restart Server

After installing nprogress:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

## That's it!

The loading bar will now appear:
- ✅ When clicking any link
- ✅ On top of the screen
- ✅ Blue progress bar
- ✅ Smooth animation
- ✅ Auto-completes when page loads

## Testing

1. Visit your site
2. Click any navigation link
3. You'll see a blue bar at the top showing progress
4. It disappears when page loads

Perfect! ✨
